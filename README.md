# Seldonian-RL
Seldonian RL library is an extension of the Seldonian Framework. 

This repository contains the implementation of Seldonian RL algorithms, which ensure high probability guarantees of safety and fairness. Other implemented components are confidence intervals, off-policy policy evaluation methods, doubly robust estimator, some black box optimization algorithms, maximum likelihood modeling of the environment using the data, function approximation with neural network using lagrange multiplier (for constrained optimization).
